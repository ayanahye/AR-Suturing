Calculate the arrow directions for guided knot tying:
(High Level Algorithm)
    1. Extraction
        - extract coordinates for segmented cut edges
        - extract coordinates for the surgeons hand position
        - thread, surgical instruments
    2. Define Pulling Directions
        - determined by expert guidance or some predefined knot-tying algorithm we create
    3. Visualize Arrows
        - generate vectors for arrows and send them to engine
            - easy computations of angles, distances
            - point from the hand with predefine length
        - direction the arrow should point and length of how long to draw the arrow
            - start point is where the surgeons hand is
            - end of the vector is where we want the arrow to point (in direction of knot pulling)
